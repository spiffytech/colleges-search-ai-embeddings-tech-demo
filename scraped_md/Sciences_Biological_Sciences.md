# Beyond Basic Biology

Our department redefines multidisciplinary when it comes to our educational and research opportunities. Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Microbiology, Paleontology, and Toxicology encompass only a few of the exciting areas in which our faculty and students are impacting global scientific challenges.

## Interested in Biology? You’ve come to the right place!

The Department of Biological Sciences is one of the largest academic units at NC State with over 2000 undergraduate majors, 100 graduate students, and ~70 faculty in diverse disciplines from genetics to paleobiology.

## **Fall 2025 Graduation**

Information on the next Biological Sciences department graduation will be available soon.

### Enriching the Student Experience Beyond the Classroom and Campus

Because so much critical learning occurs outside of the classroom, we have partnerships with communities and institutions across the state and are expanding our study abroad offerings to provide exciting opportunities for exploration, research, and engagement.

## Wicked Problems, Wolfpack Soultions **was recognized with the 2024 Gertrude Cox Award for Excellence in Teaching and Learning with Technology.**

[*Wicked Problems, Wolfpack Solutions*](https://wolfpacksolutions.ncsu.edu/) is a multidisciplinary experience created for all incoming first-year and transfer students at NC State University. Each year, this course focuses on a current “wicked problem,” defined as a highly complex problem that can only be addressed through collaborative, multidisciplinary efforts.

**Scott M. Belcher | TEDxBoston**  
\
Why would a toxicologist wrangle an alligator? North Carolina researchers are seeking to understand the effects of exposures to elevated Per- and Poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS; aka forever chemicals) by studying the impacts found in the wildlife inside high exposure areas. These species serve as sentinels to infer and reflect potential adverse impacts that might be found in human populations under similar exposures. Observing American alligators, a resilient keystone species, findings show hindered immune function in these usually robust creatures and other aquatic species.

## BioSci and NC State – a national hub for Environmental Health Sciences research

We are one of very few institutions to support several major Centers funded by the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve understanding about chemical exposures in the environment, their health impacts, and prevention.
