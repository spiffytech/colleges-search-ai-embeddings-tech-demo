## Leading the Field

We roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty to accomplish great things. Our world-class undergraduate and graduate programs prepare students to answer environmental and agricultural challenges, building on our rich history of growing agricultural and environmental sciences in North Carolina and around the globe. But our focus is on the future.

We conduct research that drives innovation and new technology, expands understanding and provides science-based information to solve problems, but we don’t stop there. We make sure our graduates, stakeholders and partners put their gained knowledge and innovation to work for a better tomorrow.
