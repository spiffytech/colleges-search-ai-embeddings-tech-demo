From the Halls of Nelson to the Graduation Stage: Meet Poole’s Student Commencement Speaker Landon Hong 🎤✨

“The main message is that it takes being uncomfortable in order to grow and accomplish extraordinary things,” Hong said. “So I wanted to literally practice what I’m preaching. This is a way for me to do that — and also give a meaningful gift to my grandparents, who will be in the audience.”

Hong’s speech preparation has involved deep reflection on the values that have shaped his college experience. Throughout his time at Poole, he found inspiration from those closest to him, starting with his parents. ❤️

Landon will deliver remarks to his fellow graduates at Poole\`s ceremony on Saturday, May 3. 🎓
