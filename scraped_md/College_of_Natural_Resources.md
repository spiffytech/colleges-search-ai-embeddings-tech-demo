Meet Rylee Miller, a rising sophomore majoring in paper science and engineering in the Department of Forest Biomaterials (@ncstatefb). This summer, she is working as a power and recovery engineering intern with International Paper in Riegelwood, North Carolina.

Through late July, Rylee is focusing primarily on the mill’s power boilers, turbines, and recovery boilers that are used to provide energy, steam, and green liquor. She is also responsible for items such as routine sampling and testing, working with the process engineers on various projects, and expanding the mill’s real-time process visualization database.

“This internship has taught me the importance of putting yourself out there, asking questions, and getting involved. While it can often be comfortable to work from your office, others notice when you take initiative to go out and help and are genuinely interested in the process.

Hard work goes a long way, and being enthusiastic about tasks that others find cumbersome, tedious, or frustrating makes the experience more enjoyable and helps you play a valuable role in mill operations.

Beyond these life lessons, this internship has also taught me practical skills that will be helpful in my future career as an engineer, such as sampling and testing, various digital tools, and how specific equipment works.”

Over the next couple of months, we will be highlighting several #NCStateCNR students and their summer internship experiences. 🐺🐾

Meet Addison Sepesi, a rising senior majoring in sustainable materials and technology in the Department of Forest Biomaterials (@ncstatefb). 👋 This summer, she is working as a continuous improvement intern with Columbia Forest Products in Chatham, Virginia.

Through August, Addison is working to set up standardized work practices and going through problem solving to continuously improve operations around Columbia Forest Products.

“This internship has significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills by teaching me a structured, step-by-step approach and how to effectively identify root causes. I’ve learned to implement targeted countermeasures that drive measurable improvements and observed firsthand how standardized practices can streamline workflows and reduce operator strain.

My time at Columbia Forest Products has also provided valuable exposure to the manufacturing industry, allowing me to explore potential career paths. Additionally, I’ve developed foundational management skills and gained confidence in public speaking through regular participation in team meetings and presentations.”
