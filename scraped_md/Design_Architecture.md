#### School of Architecture Head

David Hill, FAIA // [Email David](mailto:david_hill@ncsu.edu)

Since its founding, the School of Architecture has been a leader of innovation in design. Today that tradition continues with programs centered on design excellence and unique approaches to contemporary urban, environmental, and ethical challenges. Our fully accredited program provides a rigorous professional education paired with multidisciplinary and self-directed design and research opportunities. Multiple paths to a professional degree are provided by undergraduate and graduate degree programs, including the iPal Accelerated Path to Licensure. A Masters of Advanced Architectural Studies, Certificates and Concentrations and a Design-Build summer program provide for specialized studies. Connections to a robust architectural community offer professional opportunities.

**Mindful Design: Students Create Shade Structures for Raleigh Skate Park**  
\

The second crowning achievement: spray-painted tags appeared soon after the artfully perforated, white panels were hoisted up and secured. For the team of four instructors and 15 students, it meant they had ensured that the design connected culturally with the intended community — a principle that lies at the heart of Design + Build.](https://design.ncsu.edu/architecture/2025/06/10/mindful-design-students-create-shade-structures-for-raleigh-skate-park/)
