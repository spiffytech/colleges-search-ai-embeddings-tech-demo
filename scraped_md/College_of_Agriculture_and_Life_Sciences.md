A training program at @perduefarms is boosting career readiness for recent CALS grad Madison Turano. 🎓

Since graduating in May with a bachelor’s degree in animal science, Turano has been extending her education through a year-long, full-time position as a feed mill management trainee. Perdue Farms is a fourth-generation, family-owned, U.S. food and agriculture company with several poultry farms and facilities in North Carolina.

“I’m using all of the skills I gained from the animal care labs and my nutrition and feed milling classes; my education from NC State provides the base upon which I can solve problems,” she said. “My teamwork and cross-disciplinary collaboration skills have helped me solve issues in real time. I’m applying the production skills and data analysis I learned while conducting research, which improves efficiency.”

If you\`re a die-hard barbecue fan, you\`ve probably heard of NC State BBQ Camp. 🍖

During the two-day seminar, which celebrated its tenth anniversary this June, @FBNSNCState Professor and Meat Science Extension Specialist Dana Hanson teaches participants about the science behind low and slow. It is the only university-level, science-based course of its kind in the Southeast.

"We preach the gospel of N.C. barbecue and take all who worship at the altar of smoke and fire," said Hanson.

With over 200 people currently on the waitlist, it\`s safe to say that NC State BBQ Camp is a cult classic.
