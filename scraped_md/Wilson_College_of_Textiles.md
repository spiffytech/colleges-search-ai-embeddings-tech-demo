Fighting heat stress with fabric science — that’s hot! 🧵🔥

\\#NCStateWilson Senior Design students partnered with Workwear Outfitters, the parent company of \\@‌Dickies and \\@‌LibertyBibs, to create advanced workwear for road crews and linemen working in extreme heat.

Caitlyn Barnwell, Niamh Williams and Hannah Kirk designed a zoned passive cooling garment that works with the body’s natural thermoregulation, targeting heat-sensitive zones. The team used fabric-level testing and full garment trials with the Miliken Textile Protection and Comfort Center to provide strong recommendations to their sponsor.

The runway meets the sketchbook in FTD 218! 👗✏️✨

In FTD 218: Fashion Illustration, students learn the foundations of fashion design through the art of illustration. This studio-based course focuses on everything from figure proportion and pose to fabric rendering and styling for different occasions.

Each student displayed two to three A4-sized fashion illustration renderings during the midterm showcase. Their work reflects weeks of practice and development of drawing skills and visual design language!

Old-school tags are out. Smart fabric is in.

Sponsored by @underarmour, a Senior Design team here at #NCStateWilson took on the challenge of creating a washable, wearable electronic device that could survive 50+ laundry cycles.

The result? Team members Kayla Coppin, Cydney Cole and Tyler Hodges created a smart fabric care tag that replaces traditional tags with cutting-edge functionality. Just scan with your phone to access washing instructions, track garment life, and even communicate with smart washers and dryers!

Worldwide textile connections are so #NCStateWilson coded!

Nicole Repko (FTD-FD ‘28) went to Egypt this summer with her family, where she had the opportunity to visit the Oriental Carpet School in Cairo. At the school, she saw traditional rug making and learned about the different textiles used and the weaving process behind the rugs.

“Witnessing such a beautiful, ancient tradition has been an unforgettable experience. Watching the process has been truly eye-opening. The incredible talent around me is inspiring, and I’m completely in awe of the stunning pieces being created here,” Nicole says.

From #NCStateWilson classrooms to Nike HQ, Alexa is taking her talent to new heights! 👟✨

Alexa Karrenbauer (FTD ‘25) turned a love of crochet into an incredible textile design career at #NCStateWilson. Her senior collection, “Life is Full, I Am Full of Life,” blends handmade and machine-made pieces inspired by her Vietnamese-American heritage and her experiences abroad.

“With this collection, it was really cool to see how I could use all of the skills I’ve learned over the past few years at NC State to make these products,” Alexa says.

[![From #NCStateWilson classrooms to Nike HQ, Alexa is taking her talent to new heights! 👟✨  Alexa Karrenbauer (FTD ‘25) turned a love of crochet into an incredible textile design career at #NCStateWilson. Her senior collection, “Life is Full, I Am Full of Life,” blends handmade and machine-made pieces inspired by her Vietnamese-American heritage and her experiences abroad.  “With this collection, it was really cool to see how I could use all of the skills I’ve learned over the past few years at NC State to make these products,” Alexa says.  Alexa’s talent has now lead her to a material design internship at the Nike headquarters!

The perfect #NCStateWilson summer is made up of sun, swimming and sustainable swimwear, of course!

This Senior Design group worked to find a sustainable alternative to spandex for swimwear. The group evaluated Neolast, a type of yarn, by analyzing tensile strength, stretch recovery and fabric opacity.
