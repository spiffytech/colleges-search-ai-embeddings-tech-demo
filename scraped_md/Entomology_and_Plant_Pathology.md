# Protecting Plants, Animals and People

We work to diminish the damage done by insect pests and plant diseases — and care for the environment.

## Controlling, Curing, Cultivating

[**Top Entomology Minor**  
\
Our current undergraduate cohort consists of 80+ students from 20 majors across 6 colleges at NC State.  
\
See what the buzz is about](https://catalog.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/agriculture-life-sciences/entomology-plant-pathology/entomology-minor/)

Insects and microbes can take a bite out of farmers’ yields and threaten urban environments, yet they also bring surprising benefits. We apply cutting-edge science to harness the good while minimizing the bad.

Our undergraduate and graduate students get the hands-on entomology and plant pathology preparation they need for challenging careers in industry, government or academia.

Farmers and consumers alike benefit from our research and extension programs that solve real-world problems related to plant diseases and insects.

## Graduate Programs

We offer thesis and non-thesis master’s programs as well as Ph.D. programs in both Entomology and Plant Pathology. You will gain experience in our labs and conduct field projects while staying engaged through symposiums and seminars. We encourage professional development through mentoring, internships and industry partnerships.
