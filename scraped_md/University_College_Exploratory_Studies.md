# Welcome to Exploratory Studies

![students at Belltower](https://advising.dasa.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2021/04/belltower-jump.jpeg)

Welcome to NC State and the Exploratory Studies Program.  We are happy to have you with us and our team is committed to your success.

Exploratory Studies is a comprehensive program designed to meet the needs of first-year students who wish to explore their options in order to find a “best fit” major. With a focus on cross-curricular academic advising, career assessment, guided exploration of majors and careers, and programming that encourages students interaction with advisors, faculty, upper-class students and professionals from different fields, our students are able to discover their passions and make an informed decision on a major. Alumni from our program are represented in every college at the University, and our students are actively engaged in university life.

Exploratory Studies academic advisors work with their students one-on-one, as well as in the Exploratory Studies courses, University Studies Courses (USC) 101, 102, and 201. Our advising and curriculum address campus policies, resources and opportunities, strategies for exploring majors and careers, as well as working toward meeting personal, academic and career goals.

[Exploratory Studies Village](https://housing.dasa.ncsu.edu/residential-communities/living-learning-villages/#exploratory-studies-village), housed in Owen residence hall, supports a successful first-year residential experience for our students. The Exploratory Studies village director and Village Mentors work to build community through fun events and learning excursions that engage students through interactive programming and/or hands on learning.

Since our program’s founding in 1995 (as the First Year College), we have had the privilege of working with thousands of talented and creative students on the path to their degree. We are committed to ensuring that our students have the skills, knowledge, and experiences to transition successfully to a major that fulfills their goals.

Our mission is to guide students as they transition into the university and select a major. Our program builds foundational knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to become self-reliant and productive citizens of an increasingly diverse community.

Welcome to Exploratory Studies and Go Pack!
