The Department of Biological Sciences at NC State stands out as a vibrant hub of interdisciplinary education and innovative research dedicated to understanding the complex fabric of life. With over 2,000 undergraduates, 100 graduate students, and a faculty of approximately 70 specialists across fields like genetics, paleobiology, microbiology, and environmental sciences, the department offers a dynamic environment for inquiry and discovery. Our value lies in our commitment to pushing the boundaries of biological knowledge and translating scientific insights into solutions for pressing global challenges.

What makes us truly unique is our focus on experiential, impact-driven learning that extends beyond traditional classroom boundaries. We foster partnerships with communities and institutions to create meaningful opportunities for exploration, research, and engagement—whether through study abroad programs, outreach initiatives, or hands-on research projects. Our curriculum and activities are designed to equip students with real-world skills, critical thinking, and collaborative abilities necessary to address today’s complex biological and environmental issues.

Our department’s core mission is to redefine what it means to learn and contribute in biology. We are dedicated to cultivating a diverse, inclusive community where students and faculty work together to solve wicked problems—those highly complex issues requiring multidisciplinary approaches. From tackling environmental health concerns to advancing genomics research, our activities are focused on developing innovative solutions that impact society and the planet. With a firm belief in the power of collaboration and applied knowledge, we prepare our students to become leaders who will shape the future of biological sciences.
