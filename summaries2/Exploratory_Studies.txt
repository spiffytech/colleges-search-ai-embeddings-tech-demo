Exploratory Studies at NC State University is a dynamic and student-centered program dedicated to guiding first-year students through the crucial transition into higher education and helping them discover their true academic passions. Unlike traditional advising, our program offers personalized, cross-curricular guidance that empowers students to explore a wide range of majors and career paths. Through targeted advising, engaging courses, and experiential opportunities, we ensure students gain the skills and confidence necessary to make informed decisions about their future, setting a foundation for lifelong success.

Our core mission is to facilitate a seamless transition from high school to college specialization by providing innovative programming that fosters self-reliance, critical thinking, and a deep understanding of diverse fields. With a holistic approach that includes one-on-one advising, specialized courses like USC 101, 102, and 201, and immersive learning experiences, we address students' academic, personal, and professional development simultaneously. We are committed to building a community where students feel supported, challenged, and inspired to explore and find their best fit majors, ultimately preparing them for a vibrant and diverse career landscape.

What truly sets Exploratory Studies apart is our dedication to student engagement and community building. Located in the vibrant Exploratory Studies Village in Owen residence hall, we create an environment where students connect through diverse events, learning excursions, and meaningful interactions with faculty, advisors, and peers from all disciplines. Since our founding in 1995, we have championed the idea that exploration leads to purpose, and our alumni's diverse achievements across all colleges exemplify our success in cultivating well-rounded, confident citizens of tomorrow. Our mission is to transform the college experience into a purposeful journey of discovery, guiding students to realize their fullest potential.
