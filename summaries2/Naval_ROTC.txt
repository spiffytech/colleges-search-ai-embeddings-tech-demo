Navigation of the Naval ROTC at NC State University is dedicated to cultivating the next generation of naval officers who exemplify the highest standards of duty, honor, and integrity. Our core mission is to develop midshipmen both mentally and morally, ensuring they embody the principles of leadership, discipline, and service that are vital to their future roles in the Navy and Marine Corps. We emphasize a holistic approach, integrating rigorous academic training, physical development, and character-building activities to prepare students not just to serve, but to lead with a sense of honor and unwavering commitment.

Unique to our program is our focus on real-world leadership experiences, including trauma-based drills, community engagement, and hands-on naval sciences education. We provide unparalleled opportunities for midshipmen to participate in leadership labs, tactical training, and community service initiatives that simulate the demands of active military service. Our students gain a competitive edge by learning to operate within a strict code of conduct, fostering teamwork, resilience, and strategic thinking that set them apart in both military and civilian careers.

Our department is committed to shaping disciplined leaders capable of making decisive contributions to national security and American values. We inspire our midshipmen through a strong tradition of excellence and a deep sense of responsibility, ensuring they graduate not only with a degree but with the moral compass and leadership skills necessary to navigate complex challenges. Joining us means becoming part of a proud legacy of service, where integrity, courage, and loyalty are more than wordsâ€”they are the foundation of a life dedicated to the service of others.
