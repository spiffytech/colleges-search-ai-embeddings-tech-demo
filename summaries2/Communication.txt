The Department of Communication at NC State University stands out for its innovative approach to understanding and advancing human interaction in a rapidly evolving media landscape. Rooted in a commitment to explore how messages are created, transmitted, and received across diverse channels, our department emphasizes practical engagement with contemporary communication challenges. We prioritize equipping students with the skills to critically analyze media, enhance public discourse, and develop effective strategies for organizations and communities facing complex information environments.

Our core value lies in fostering a community of proactive doers who are dedicated not just to understanding communication theory but to applying it to real-world issues. Through hands-on internships, research initiatives, and engagement with top organizations worldwide, students develop a multi-faceted perspective on communication media, public relations, digital humanities, and crisis management. This practical focus ensures graduates are not only knowledgeable but also ready to lead in professional settings demanding innovative communication solutions.

Unique to our department is our emphasis on media-in-context—examining messages within their societal, cultural, and technological environments. Our faculty conduct cutting-edge research on topics like crisis communication strategies and the influence of media on public opinion, with an active program dedicated to digital humanities and public science leadership. We are committed to empowering students to become adaptable, socially conscious communicators who can navigate and shape the complex narrative landscape of today’s interconnected world.
