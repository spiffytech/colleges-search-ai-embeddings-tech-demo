The Agricultural Institute offers accelerated two-year degree programs preparing students for immediate careers in agriculture. Our hands-on curriculum integrates industry technology through facilities like the Lake Wheeler Road Field Laboratory.

Unique programs like Food Animal and Poultry Processing address critical workforce needs. Industry partnerships provide internship opportunities and career pathways in agribusiness, livestock management, and sustainable farming.

The Sycamore Stipend Fund supports veteran students while Spend-A-Day visits showcase our programs. Graduates enter the workforce with practical skills or continue to four-year degrees through our Associates to Bachelors pathway.

As part of NC State's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, we advance the land-grant mission through workforce development that strengthens North Carolina's agricultural industry.
