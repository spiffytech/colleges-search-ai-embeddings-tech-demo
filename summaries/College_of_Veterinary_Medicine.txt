As a top-ranked veterinary program, we advance animal and human health through NIH-funded research like Dr. Laplante's $2M cell division study. Our clinical trials program offers cutting-edge treatments unavailable elsewhere.

Unique externships provide hands-on experience from beef cattle ranches to South African wildlife preserves. The Fig and Frank educational series makes veterinary science accessible to pet owners nationwide.

Signature facilities include the Biosafety Level 3 Biocontainment Lab and Veterinary Hospital delivering specialized care. We train healers through our innovative House System that builds clinical skills and community.
