Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences integrates oceanography, geology and meteorology to study Earth's interconnected systems. The department leads in developing HazMapper, a cloud-based geo-hazard application used globally for disaster risk assessment. Students access unique field research opportunities from Arctic expeditions to Caribbean coral reef studies.

The Blue Economy Innovation Program partners with coastal communities to develop sustainable solutions for marine ecosystems. Faculty research on climate change impacts includes groundbreaking studies on wildfire nutrient cycles and Arctic smoke plumes. The department maintains a 95% graduate placement rate with alumni in key positions at NOAA, NASA and USGS.

Students benefit from state-of-the-art facilities including the Center for Marine Sciences and Technology. The program offers hands-on training through storm chase expeditions and research vessel operations. These experiences prepare graduates for careers in climate science, natural resource management and environmental consulting.

We drive scientific discovery through interdisciplinary research tackling global challenges in health, energy and environment. Our top-ranked mathematical sciences programs and Goldwater Scholarship winners demonstrate excellence in STEM education. The Integrative Sciences Initiative creates collaborative spaces for breakthrough innovation, while the Data Science and AI Academy prepares students for emerging technologies.
