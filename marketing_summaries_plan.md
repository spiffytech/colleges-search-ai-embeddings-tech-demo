# Marketing-Focused College Department Summaries - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Create compelling marketing-focused summaries for college departments and programs from scraped markdown content, emphasizing unique value propositions and competitive advantages.

**Input**: 80+ markdown files in `scraped_md/` directory
**Output**: Plain text summary files in `summaries/` directory
**Structure**: 3 paragraphs per department + 1 paragraph about parent college

## Content Quality Assessment

### Analysis Results
After examining the scraped content, files fall into three categories:

**High-Quality Content (25-30 files)**
- Rich program descriptions with specific details
- Student success stories and outcomes data
- Research initiatives and industry partnerships
- Faculty expertise and achievements
- Unique facilities or resources

**Limited Content (20-25 files)**
- Basic program listings without detail
- Mostly navigation menus
- Generic academic descriptions
- Insufficient unique differentiators

**Insufficient Content (25-30 files)**
- Empty files or redirects
- Only navigation elements
- No substantive program information
- Cannot generate meaningful summaries

### Content Quality Examples

**Substantial Content Example**: Wilson College of Textiles
- Specific programs: Fashion and Textile Design, Textile Engineering
- Industry partnerships and career outcomes
- Research facilities and innovation centers
- Student success metrics and achievements

**Insufficient Content Example**: Animal Science
- Empty file with no content
- Cannot generate meaningful summary

## Summary Structure & Approach

### 4-Paragraph Format

**Paragraphs 1-3: Department Focus**
1. **Unique Programs & Competitive Advantages**
   - Distinctive degree offerings
   - Specialized facilities or resources
   - Industry partnerships and connections

2. **Student Outcomes & Success Metrics**
   - Employment rates and career placement
   - Notable alumni achievements
   - Hands-on learning opportunities
   - Internship and co-op programs

3. **Research Innovation & Faculty Expertise**
   - Cutting-edge research initiatives
   - Faculty recognition and expertise
   - Grant funding and industry collaboration
   - Real-world impact and applications

**Paragraph 4: Parent College Context**
- College's overall mission and values
- How the department fits within college strategy
- College-wide resources and support
- Institutional reputation and standing

### Marketing Tone Guidelines

**Focus Areas**:
- Measurable outcomes (employment rates, salary data, rankings)
- Industry recognition and partnerships
- Unique facilities, equipment, or resources
- Student success stories and achievements
- Research impact and innovation
- Career advancement opportunities

**Avoid**:
- Generic academic language
- Traits common to all departments
- Vague mission statements
- Standard curriculum descriptions

## Technical Implementation Plan
